# Copilot Instructions - crUPto

## Purpose
crUPto is a cryptocurrency portfolio and tax-reporting application. Keep wallet processing, data extraction, reporting, and CLI concerns cleanly separated.
This file is minimal by design. All general rules, agent edit policies, and centralized log/config options are defined in the modular copilot-instructions files.

Refer to:
- [Modular copilot-instructions](./copilot-instructions.d/*.md) for extensions to the general rules in this file.

## Shared Policies Propagated from dev_local/.github
- Treat this repository as its own root. Do not depend on parent dev_local paths existing on another machine.
- Keep all config, logs, tests, and output locations config-driven. Respect ROOT_MODES, PATHS, LOG_FILES, and any `.d` override directories.
- Never hardcode machine-specific absolute paths.
- Use tUilKit config and logging patterns for production code; prefer factory-based access to shared services where available.
- Use semantic colour/log keys such as `!info`, `!proc`, `!done`, `!warn`, `!error`, `!path`, `!file`, `!data`, `!test`, `!pass`, `!fail`, and `!date`.
- Keep tests deterministic and update test bootstrap files such as `tests/test_paths.json` when path behavior changes.
- Update `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `pyproject.toml`, and config version fields together when behavior or releases change.
- Keep changelog dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and place substantive docs under `docs/`.

## Project-Specific Rules
- Keep portfolio calculations, wallet ingestion, and reporting logic independent from CLI entry-point code.
- Use the configured project/workspace data roots rather than literal user-directory paths.
- Config and mappings should stay externalized under `config/`.
- New parsing or import routines should be deterministic and covered by tests for expected input variations.

## Building Exemplar Policy

The `examples/` folder must include supplementary scripts that run outside pytest and stress public APIs and menu/error paths.

Requirements:
- Exercise all public functions across normal and adversarial input scenarios.
- Deliberately stress UI/menu edge cases (empty input, out-of-range values, special characters, very long strings).
- Produce visual, interactive, colour-logged output alongside structured logs for human review.
- Keep scripts as living behavior documentation.
- Maintain an `examples/exemplar.py` mock application entry point.

`examples/exemplar.py` should:
- Load tUilKit factory imports in verbose mode where available (for example, ConfigLoader).
- Generate a standard CLI menu with project header and submenus.
- Read the project primary config file.
- Read and test-load all `ROOT_MODES`.
- Verify and display resolved paths for `LOG_FILES`, config files, and input data files.
